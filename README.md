A Java-based game that pits two AI algorithms — Minimax and Greedy — against each other in a competitive environment.

After each round, both AI agents make decisions, and their scores are displayed to show the effectiveness of their strategies.

Features
Turn-based gameplay between Minimax and Greedy AIs
Score tracking after each round
Simple interface focused on algorithm behavior

Purpose
Built to explore and compare AI decision-making strategies in a controlled game scenario.
Made as part of the requirements for Data Structures and Algorithms coursework.
